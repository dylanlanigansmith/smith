# TODO


- enemy so messed up
    - AI is broken
    - base class needed
    - goal: can put 100 on a map and let them fight for an hour


- save entities with level def

- generic prop and prop editor 
    - make it easy to add event triggers
    - ex:
        - ammo box
        - invisible changelevel
        - door button



- if we are doing pitch:
    - hit box editor 
    - hitboxes
        - make hitreg universal for CBaseEnt stuff
    - hit animations 

- if we are doing crouching:
    - need half walls / vents
    - agh

- try to hate the level format less

- player:
    - footsteps
    - real HUD
    - shot gun
    - pickup weapons

- engine states
    - ui
    - better than fire event for like changelevel

- npcs
    - need positional audio with dynamic position changing 
        - i think... you can do callbacks and pass audiostruct so doesnt wreck current system that much
    - cut scene? 

- particles
- half walls
- dynamic lights




- replace weapon art with my own
- replace enemy art with my own (blender SS ??)

- make game


# game ideas

- spaceship first person FTL sorta thing
    - would be cool multiplayer
    - done before

- half life
    - takes all my will not to accidentally remake it

- just shooting
    - not fun
    - cant be better than doom or those indie games on steam that make being doom 2 their whole shtick

- clausterphobia simulator
    - good excuse for the lack of variable ceiling heights



#### Genre/Tropes
- horror / dark 
    - lighting is all we got 
- tomb raider
