# RETRO TEXTURE PACK

Hey, thanks so much for trying out my retro-style texture pack. I started
creating these to make a retro styled FPS, inspired by games like DOOM and Quake,
but it was taking too much time away from my main project, so I decided to
release them as a texture pack instead.

## CONTENTS

There is currently a total of *345* unique textures, though there are a lot of
variants, so some of the textures are similar.

## LICENSE

You are welcome to use the textures in this pack in any non-commercial and
commercial works. You may not, however, distribute any of the textures in this
pack in any format, even if you have modified them.
